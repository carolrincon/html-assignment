                <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
                
                <p>I'm a 22 years old Colombian Filmmaker, but right now I'm an international student at Algonquin College, in Canada.<br>
                    I choose to study the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program to expand my field and contribute even more to my career expectations.<br> I would like to make content for children, mostly for their learning process. From media content<br> throughout videos, animations until book illustrations. </abbr> </p>
                
                <p>People says that I am a really <em>courious</em> person, because I'm into a lot of diverse activities. For instance, bookbinding,<br> gardening, astronomy, bakering, learning japanese and of course Stop Motion!. If you are wandering <br>if I have time for do <em> all this...</em> well just wait to know that I also opened the <strong> <a href="https://www.algonquinsa.com/profile/stop-motion-club/"><abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr> Stop Motion Club</a></strong>. We are just starting <br>like a small community, but I have in mind many and fun plans to make it a pleasant club to be part and proud of.</p>
